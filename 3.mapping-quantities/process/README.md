## Process

Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.

Process - 1&2
Time line showing the height of rocket and nuclear bomb
Timeline showing how many animals and human were in space
Map showing launch location for rocket & nuclear bomb (with time of day & yield)

Process - first draft
Line graph is showing test numbers from US & USSR.
Dot with textures is showing every space launch and crew status.
Icons shows detailed space launch crew makeup.
Color block showing the total yield of given year by US & USSR.

Process - final
1) Line graph is showing test numbers from US & USSR.
Dot with textures is showing every space launch and crew status.
But the graph is treated vertically and present a clear comparison between 2 countries. The line graph the reference grid are set in low opacity and more referential data changed in color to be viewed as the background layer.
2)the graph with icons are spaced out and bigger in size. Each launch is labelled with number for the next poster's reference. The nuclear data is deleted from this graph.
3)this photo gallery shows every life form involved in the data in this project. Each one is tinted with their country's color and labelled with their names. 4 human who lose their lives are not tinted and remain black and white.
