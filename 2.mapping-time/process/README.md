Description of the contents of this folder and the logic of your data â†’ retinal variables mapping.

## Map1: color, position - need revision on the visuals##
The background color reflects time in minutes (0-60);
The position of the dot reflects hours (0-24);
The filled up gradient reflects seconds;

## Map2:rotation & transparency ##
The quarter arc would turn random (90,180,270degree) and transparency would add up to 100% when each arc is called.

So each arc would be in an array. The blue one is the seconds, every seconds increases, there would be a new arc turning and deepening in color. Same with minute & hour.

## Map3: need to redo ##
